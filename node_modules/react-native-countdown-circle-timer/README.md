## Installation

```
yarn add react-native-countdown-circle-timer
```

or

```
npm install react-native-countdown-circle-timer
```

## Prerequisites

This component has a peer dependency on `react-native-svg` to draw the countdown circle. `react-native-svg` has to be installed and linked into your project

## Demo

## Basic usage

```jsx
import { CountdownCircleTimer } from 'react-native-countdown-circle-timer'

const UrgeWithPleasureComponent = () => (
  <CountdownCircleTimer
    isPlaying
    duration={10}
    colors={[
      ['#004777', 0.4],
      ['#F7B801', 0.4],
      ['#A30000', 0.2],
    ]}
  >
    {({ remainingTime, animatedColor }) => (
      <Animated.Text style={{ color: animatedColor }}>
        {remainingTime}
      </Animated.Text>
    )}
  </CountdownCircleTimer>
)
```
